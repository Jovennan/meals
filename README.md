A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is part of my studies on course -[Aprenda Flutter e Desenvolva Apps Para Android e IOS 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-flutter/learn/lecture/18455040#overview).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
